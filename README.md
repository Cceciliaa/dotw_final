# Drawing on the Web Final Project
## City Memories

City born and city bread, I am more than familiar with city landscapes and architectures, and yet, the unique designs of the buildings never fail to fascinate me. In fact, my memories of cities are usually snapshots of their skyscrapers, standing closely in clusters in the sunlight.

I have been moving around in different cities in the past few years, and enjoyed different vibes that each offers. In particular, New York, where I lived and studied for the past year, impresses me with the pretty view of its skyline; Shanghai, where my college's home campus locates, lives in my memory as a mixture of various bright colors, with the colorful LED lights lightening nearly all of the major streets in the city; and lastly, Guangzhou, where I was born and raised, has always been known as the city of flowers, welcoming its visiotrs livelily throughout the year.

For this project, I put together three pictures of the city landscape of New York, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, drawing them on HTML canvas and manipulating their colors and textures. For the drawing of New York City, I use three different images of oil paintings of the sky and present the transition of the sky color in a day; for shanghai, I draw a picture of its night with fancy lighting effects; and lastly, for guangzhou, I decorate its city view with several gifs of flowers. 

I put together the three drawings of "postcards" on a landing page, which is accessible through this link: http://i6.cims.nyu.edu/~zc1151/dotw_final/index.html.
