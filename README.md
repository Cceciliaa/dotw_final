# Drawing on the Web Final Project
## City Memories

City born and city bread, I am more than familiar with city views, and yet, the unique cultures and lifestyles of different cities never fail to fascinate me. 

I have been moving around in different cities in the past few years, and enjoyed different vibes that each offers. In particular, New York, where I lived and studied for the past year, impresses me with the pretty view of its skyline; Shanghai, where my college's home campus locates, lives in my memory as a city of lights, with the colorful LED lights lightening nearly all of the major streets; and lastly, Guangzhou, where I was born and raised, has always inspired me with its liveliness, for, throughout different seasons of the year, there are always some kinds of flowers blossoming.

For this project, I put together three pictures of the city landscape of New York, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, drawing them on HTML canvas and manipulating their colors and textures. Each of the drawings represents my distinctive memory of the respective city. For the drawing of New York City, I use three different images of oil paintings of the sky and present the transition of the sky color in a day; for Shanghai, I draw a picture of its night with fancy light effects; and lastly, for Guangzhou, I decorate its city view with several GIFs of flowers.
