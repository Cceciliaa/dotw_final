# Drawing on the Web Final Project
## The Colored Postcards of the Cities

City born and city bread, I am more than familiar with city landscapes and architectures, and yet, the unique designs of the buildings never fail to fascinate me. In fact, my memories of cities are usually snapshots of their skyscrapers, standing closely in clusters in the sunlight.

Moving around in different cities, I somehow develop the habit of describing my vibes towards the cities in colors. In particular, New York, where I lived and studied for the past year, is blue and green, blue for the sky and the great river view, and green for the symbol of money, as well as the greenery in the city; Shanghai, where my college's home campus locates, is a mixure of various bright colors, standing for the colorful LED lights shining along the major streets and the diverse cultures that lighten the city; and lastly, Guangzhou, where I was born and raised, is pink, representing the flowers booming throughout all the seasons, as well as the passion and friendliness of its people.

For this project, I put together three pictures of the city landscape of New York, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, drawing them on HTML canvas and manipulating their colors and textures.
