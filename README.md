# Drawing on the Web Final Project
## The Colored Postcards of the Cities

City born and city bread, I am more than familiar with city landscapes and architectures, and yet, the unique designs of the buildings never fail to fascinate me. In fact, my memories of cities are usually snapshots of their skyscrapers, standing closely in clusters in the sunlight.

Moving around in different cities, I somehow develop the habit of describing my vibes towards the cities in colors. In particular, New York, where I lived and studied for the past year, is blue and green, blue for the sky and the great river view, and green for the symbol of money, as well as the greenery in the city; Shanghai, where my college's home campus locates, is a mixture of various bright colors, standing for the colorful LED lights shining along the major streets and the diverse cultures that lighten the city; and lastly, Guangzhou, where I was born and raised, is pink, representing the flowers booming throughout all the seasons, as well as the passion and friendliness of its people.

For this project, I put together three pictures of the city landscape of New York, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, drawing them on HTML canvas and manipulating their colors and textures. I choose three paintings respectively for the three cities, whose colors correspond to my feelings for the cities, and read colors from these paintings and apply them to redrawing the city landscapes. Each scene will be animated with light effects and background music, presenting as an interactive electronic postcard. There are 3D elements added to express my memories of the cities.

The drawing of the postcards is animated by the user through moving the mouse around on the canvas.
